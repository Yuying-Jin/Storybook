            During this project, I mostly worked on the HTML and CSS (with some XSLT and XML debugging). My greatest experience was with the CSS. I was assigned to be the designer of this website, which was 100% fine with me! So, I let my imagination lead me with these pages.  Along with our consultant, Professor Beshero of Penn State: The Behrend Campus, I worked on making the image frames for each page wrap around the correspond page content. This was very much a game of trial and error, but that is one of my favorite ways to learn in this medium. I also drew the cursor image! However, I cannot take credit for the cursor actually working, that was all #yxj!
