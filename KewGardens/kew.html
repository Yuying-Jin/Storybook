         "Wherever does one have one's tea?" she 
         asked with the oddest thrill of excitement 
         in her voice, looking vaguely round and letting 
         herself be drawn on down the <span class="nature">grass path</span>, trailing 
         her parasol, turning her <span class="nature">head</span> this way and that 
         way, forgetting her tea, wishing to go down there 
         and then down there, remembering orchids and 
         cranes among wild <span class="nature">flower</span>s, a Chinese <span class="tech">pagoda</span> and 
         a<span class="nature"> crimson-crested bird</span>; but he bore her on.

         Thus one couple after another with much the same irregular

         were enveloped in layer after layer of <span class="color">green blue</span> 
         vapour, in which at first their <span class="nature">bodies</span> had substance 
         and a dash of colour, but later both substance and 
         colour dissolved in the <span class="color">green-blue</span> and atmosphere. How 
         hot it was! So hot that even the thrush chose to 
         hop, like a mechanical <span class="nature">bird</span>, in the shadow of the 
         <span class="nature">flower</span>s, with long pauses between one movement and 
         the next; instead of rambling vaguely the <span class="color">white</span> 
         <span class="nature">butterflies</span> danced one above another, making 
         with their <span class="color">white</span> shifting flakes the outline of a 
         shattered marble column above the tallest

         shone as if a whole market full

         in the <span class="nature">sun</span>; and in the drone of the
