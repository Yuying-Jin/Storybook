      <p pageNum="3"><small>3</small> This edition, published in 1927, is limited to 500 numbered copies, of which
         this is number 150 </p>
      <p pageNum="4"><small>4</small> From the oval-shaped flower-bed there rose perhaps a hundred stalks spreading
         into heart-shaped or tongue-shaped leaves half way up and unfurling at the tip red
         or
         blue or yellow petals marked with spots of colour raised upon the surface; and from
         the
         red, blue or yellow gloom of the throat emerged a straight bar, rough with gold dust
         and
         slightly clubbed at the end. </p>
      <p pageNum="5"><small>5</small> The petals were voluminous enough to be stirred by the summer breeze, and when
         they moved, the red, blue and yellow lights passed one over the other, staining an
         inch
         of the brown earth beneath with a spot of the most intricate colour. The light fell
         either upon the smooth, grey back of a pebble, or, the shell of a snail with its brown,
         circular veins, or falling into a raindrop, it expanded with such intensity of red,
         blue
         and yellow the thin walls of water that one expected them to burst and disappear.
         Instead, the drop was left in a second silver grey once more, and the light now settled
         upon the flesh of a leaf, revealing the branching thread of fibre beneath the surface,
         and again it moved on and spread its illumination in the vast green spaces beneath
         the
         dome of the heart-shaped and tongue-shaped leaves. </p>
      <p pageNum="6"><small>6</small> Then the breeze stirred rather more briskly overhead and the colour was flashed
         into the air above, into the eyes of the men and women who walk in Kew Gardens in
         July.
         The figures of these men and women straggled past the flower-bed with a curiously
         irregular movement not unlike that of the white and blue butterflies who crossed the
         turf in zig-zag flights from bed to bed. The man was about six inches in front of
         the
         woman, strolling carelessly, while she bore on with greater purpose, only turning
         her
         head now and then to see that the children were not too far behind. The man kept this
         distance in front of the woman purposely, though perhaps unconsciously, for he wished
         to
         go on with his thoughts. </p>

         "Fifteen years ago I came here with
         Lily," he thought. "We sat somewhere over
         there by a lake and I begged her to marry me
         all through the hot afternoon. How the dragon-
         fly kept circling round us: how clearly I see
         the dragon-fly and her shoe with the square
         silver buckle at the toe. All the time I spoke
         I saw her shoe and when it moved impatiently
         I knew without looking up what she was going
         to say: the whole of her seemed to be in her shoe.
         And my love, my desire, were in the dragonfly;
         for some reason I thought that if it settled
         there, on that leaf, the broad one with the
         red flower in the middle of it, if the
         dragon-fly settled on the leaf she would
         say "Yes" at once.

         But the dragon-fly went round and round: it
         never settled anywhere—of course not, happily
         not, or I shouldn't be walking here with Eleanor
         and the children—Tell me, Eleanor. D'you
         ever think of the past?"
         "Why do you ask, Simon?"
         "Because I've been thinking of the past.
         I've been thinking of Lily, the woman I might
         have married.... Well, why are you silent? Do
         you mind my thinking of the past?"
         "Why should I mind, Simon? Doesn't one always
         think of the past, in a garden with men and
         women lying under the trees? Aren't they one's
         past, all that remains of it, those men and women,
         those ghosts lying under the trees,... one's happiness,
         one's reality?"
         "For me, a square silver shoe buckle and a
         dragon-fly—"

         "For me, a kiss. Imagine six little girls sitting
         before their easels twenty years ago, down by
         the side of a lake, painting the water-lilies,
         the first red water-lilies I'd ever seen. And
         suddenly a kiss, there on the back of my
         neck. And my hand shook all the after-
         noon so that I couldn't paint. I took out
         my watch and marked the hour when I
         would allow myself to think of the kiss
         for five minutes only—it was so precious—
         the kiss of an old grey-haired woman with
         a wart on her nose, the mother of all my
         kisses all my life. Come, Caroline, come,
         Hubert.
         "They walked on past the flower-bed, now
         walking four abreast, and soon diminished in
         size among the trees and looked half trans-
         parent as the sunlight and shade swam over their
         backs in large trembling irregular patches.

         He was talking about spirits—the
         spirits of the dead, 
         who, according to him, were even now telling him 
         all sorts of odd things about their experiences in 
         Heaven. 
         "Heaven was known to the ancients as
         Thessaly, 
         William, and now, with this war, the
         spirit matter 
         is rolling between the <span class="nature">hills</span> like
         <span class="nature">thunder</span>." He 
         paused, seemed to listen, smiled, jerked his <span class="nature">head</span> and 
         continued:—
         "You have a small eletric <span class="tech">battery</span> and a piece of 
         rubber to insulate the wire—isolate?—insulate?—well, 
         we'll skip the details, no good going into details that 
         wouldn't be understood—and in short the little machine
         stands in any convenient position by the head of the 
         bed, we will say, on a neat <span class="nature">mahogany</span> stand. All 
         arrangements being properly fixed by workmen under 
         my direction, the widow applies her <span class="nature">ear</span> and summons 
         the spirit by sign as agreed, Women! Widows! 
         Women in black—"

         Here he seemed to have caught sight of a woman's <span class="tech">dress</span>
         in the distance, which in the shade looked a <span class="color">purple black</span>. 
         He took off his <span class="tech">hat</span>, placed his <span class="nature">hand</span>
         upon his <span class="nature">heart</span>, 
         and hurried towards her muttering and gesticulating 
         feverishly. But William caught him by
         the sleeve and 
         touched a <span class="nature">flower</span> with the tip of his walking-stick in order 
         to divert the old man's attention. After looking at it for 
         a moment in some confusion the old man bent his 
         <span class="nature">ear</span> to it and seemed to answer a voice speaking from 
         it, for he began talking about the <span class="nature">forests</span> of 
         Uruguay which he had visited hundreds of years 
         ago in company with the most beautiful young 
         woman in Europe. He could be heard mur-
         muring about <span class="nature">forests</span> of Uruguay
         blanketed 
         with the wax <span class="nature">petals</span> of tropical <span class="nature">roses</span>, <span class="nature">night-
            ingales</span>, sea <span class="nature">beaches</span>, mermaids, and women drowned 
         at sea, as he suffered himself to be moved on by 
         William, upon whose <span class="nature">face</span> the look of 
         stoical patience grew slowly deeper 
         and deeper.

         Following his steps so closely as to be slightly puzzled

         too far off to be certain whether the gestures
         were merely eccentric or genuinely mad. After 
         they had scrutinised the old man' back in 
         silence for a moment and given each other 
         a queer, sly look, they went on energeticlly 
         piecing together their very complicated 
         dialogue:

         The <span class="nature">ponderous</span> woman looked through the pattern of falling 
         words at the <span class="nature">flower</span>s standing cool, firm and upright 
         in the earth, with a curious expression. She saw them 
         as a sleeper waking from a heavy sleep sees a brass 
         candlestick reflecting the light in an unfamiliar way, and 
         closes his <span class="nature">eyes</span> and opens them, 
         and seeing the brass candlestick again, 
         finally starts wide awake and stares at the candle-

         woman came to a standstill opposite the 
         <span class="shape">oval</span> shaped flower bed, and ceased even 
         to pretend to listen to what the other woman 
         was saying. She stood there letting the words fall 
         over her, swaying the top part 
         of her <span class="nature">body</span> slowly backwards 
         and forwards, looking at the 
         <span class="nature">flower</span>s. Then she suggested that

         even by the tip of his horns would bear his 
         weight; and this determined him finally to 
         creep and beneath it, for there was a point where 
         the <span class="nature">leaf</span> curved high enough from the ground 
         to admit him. He had just inserted his <span class="nature">head</span>
