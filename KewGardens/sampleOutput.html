         He was talking about spirits—the
         spirits of the dead, 
         who, according to him, were even now telling him 
         all sorts of odd things about their experiences in 
         Heaven. 
         "Heaven was known to the ancients as
         Thessaly, 
         William, and now, with this war, the
         spirit matter 
         is rolling between the <span class="nature">hills</span> like
         <span class="nature">thunder</span>." He 
         paused, seemed to listen, smiled, jerked his <span class="nature">head</span> and 
         continued:—
         "You have a small eletric <span class="tech">battery</span> and a piece of 
         rubber to insulate the wire—isolate?—insulate?—well, 
         we'll skip the details, no good going into details that 
         wouldn't be understood—and in short the little machine
         stands in any convenient position by the head of the 
         bed, we will say, on a neat <span class="nature">mahogany</span> stand. All 
         arrangements being properly fixed by workmen under 
         my direction, the widow applies her <span class="nature">ear</span> and summons 
         the spirit by sign as agreed, Women! Widows! 
         Women in black—"

         Here he seemed to have caught sight of a woman's <span class="tech">dress</span>
         in the distance, which in the shade looked a <span class="color">purple black</span>. 
         He took off his <span class="tech">hat</span>, placed his <span class="nature">hand</span>
         upon his <span class="nature">heart</span>, 
         and hurried towards her muttering and gesticulating 
         feverishly. But William caught him by
         the sleeve and 
         touched a <span class="nature">flower</span> with the tip of his walking-stick in order 
         to divert the old man's attention. After looking at it for 
         a moment in some confusion the old man bent his 
         <span class="nature">ear</span> to it and seemed to answer a voice speaking from 
         it, for he began talking about the <span class="nature">forests</span> of 
         Uruguay which he had visited hundreds of years 
         ago in company with the most beautiful young 
         woman in Europe. He could be heard mur-
         muring about <span class="nature">forests</span> of Uruguay
         blanketed 
         with the wax <span class="nature">petals</span> of tropical <span class="nature">roses</span>, <span class="nature">night-
            ingales</span>, sea <span class="nature">beaches</span>, mermaids, and women drowned 
         at sea, as he suffered himself to be moved on by 
         William, upon whose <span class="nature">face</span> the look of 
         stoical patience grew slowly deeper 
         and deeper.

         Following his steps so closely as to be slightly puzzled 
         by his gestures came two elderly women of the 
         lower middle class, one <span class="nature">stout</span> and <span class="nature">ponderous</span>, 
         the other <span class="nature">rosy-checked</span> and <span class="nature">nimble</span>. Like most 
         people of their station they were frankly fascinated 
         by any sign of eccentricity betokening a disordered 
         <span class="nature">brain</span>, especially in the well-to-do; but they were 
         too far off to be certain whether the gestures
         were merely eccentric or genuinely mad. After 
         they had scrutinised the old man' back in 
         silence for a moment and given each other 
         a queer, sly look, they went on energeticlly 
         piecing together their very complicated 
         dialogue: 
         "Nell, Bert, Lot, Cess, Phil, Pa, he says, I says, 
         she says, I says, I says, I says—"
         "My Bert, Sis, Bill, Grandad, the old man, 
         sugar. 
         Sugar, flour, kippers, greens, 
         Sugar, sugar, sugar.

         The <span class="nature">ponderous</span> woman looked through the pattern of falling 
         words at the <span class="nature">flowers</span> standing cool, firm and upright 
         in the earth, with a curious expression. She saw them 
         as a sleeper waking from a heavy sleep sees a brass 
         candlestick reflecting the light in an unfamiliar way, and 
         closes his <span class="nature">eyes</span> and opens them, 
         and seeing the brass candlestick again, 
         finally starts wide awake and stares at the candle-
         stick with all his powers. So the heavy 
         woman came to a standstill opposite the 
         <span class="shape">oval</span> shaped flower bed, and ceased even 
         to pretend to listen to what the other woman 
         was saying. She stood there letting the words fall 
         over her, swaying the top part 
         of her <span class="nature">body</span> slowly backwards 
         and forwards, looking at the 
         <span class="nature">flowers</span>. Then she suggested that 
         they should find a seat 
         and have their tea.

         The <span class="nature">snail</span> had now considered every possible method 
         of reaching his goal without going round the 
         dead <span class="nature">leaf</span> or climbing over it. Let alone 
         the effort needed for climbing a <span class="nature">leaf</span>, he was 
         doubtful whether the thin texture which vibrated 
         with such an alarming crackle when touched 
         even by the tip of his horns would bear his 
         weight; and this determined him finally to 
         creep and beneath it, for there was a point where 
         the <span class="nature">leaf</span> curved high enough from the ground 
         to admit him. He had just inserted his <span class="nature">head</span> 
         in the opening and was taking stock of the 
         high <span class="color">brown</span> roof and was getting used to the 
         cool <span class="color">brown</span> light when two other people came 
         past outside on the <span class="nature">turf</span>. This time they were 
         both young, a young man and a young woman.

         They were both in the prime of youth, 
         or even in that season which precedes the prime 
         of youth, the season before the smooth <span class="color">pink</span> folds 
         of the <span class="nature">flowers</span> have burst their gummy case, when the 
         wings of the <span class="nature">butterfly</span>, though fully grown, are motionless 
         in the <span class="nature">sun</span>.
         "Lucky it isn't Friday," he observed.
         "Why? D'you believe in luck?"
         "They make you pay sixpence on Friday."
         What's sixpence anyway? Isn't it worth 
         sixpence?"
         "What's 'it'—what do you mean by
         'it'?"
         "O anything—I mean—you know what I mean."
         Long pauses came between each of these remarks; 
         they were uttered in toneless and monotonous voices. 
         The couple stood still on the edge of the flower 
         bed, and together pressed the end of her parasol 
         deep down into the <span class="nature">soft earth</span>.

         The action and the fact that his <span class="nature">hand</span> 
         rested on the top of hers expressed their feelings 
         in a strange way, as these short insignificant words 
         also expressed something, words with short wings 
         for their heavy body of meaning, inadequate to 
         carry them far and thus alighting awkwardly upon 
         the very common objects that surrounded them 
         and were to their inexperienced touch so massive: 
         but who knows (so they thought as they pressed 
         the parasol into the <span class="nature">earth</span>) what precipices aren't 
         concealed in them, or what ridges of <span class="nature">ice</span> don't 
         shine in the <span class="nature">sun</span> on the other side? who 
         knows? Who has ever seen this before? Even 
         when she wondered what sort of tea they gave 
         you at Kew he felt that something loomed up 
         behind her words and stood vast and solid behind 
         them; and the mist very slowly rose and uncovered

         —O heavens!— what were those shapes?—little 
         <span class="color">white</span> tables, and waitresses who looked first at 
         her and then at him; and there was a bill 
         that he would pay with a real two shilling 
         piece, and it was real, all real, he assured 
         himself, fingering the coin in his pocket, 
         real to everyone except to hum and to her; 
         even to him it began to seem real; and 
         then—but it was too exciting to stand and
         think any longer, and he pulled the parasol 
         out of the <span class="nature">earth</span> with a jerk and was 
         impatient to find the place 
         where one had tea with other 
         people, like other people.

         "Come along, Trissie; it's time we had our 
         tea."
         "Wherever does one have one's tea?" she 
         asked with the oddest thrill of excitement 
         in her voice, looking vaguely round and letting 
         herself be drawn on down the <span class="nature">grass path</span>, trailing 
         her parasol, turning her <span class="tech">head</span> this way and that 
         way, forgetting her tea, wishing to go down there 
         and then down there, remembering orchids and 
         cranes among wild <span class="nature">flowers</span>, a Chinese <span class="tech">pagoda</span> and 
         a<span class="nature"> crimson-crested bird</span>; but he bore her on.

         Thus one couple after another with much the same irregular 
         and aimless movement passed the flower-bed and 
         were enveloped in layer after layer of <span class="color">green blue</span> 
         vapour, in which at first their <span class="nature">bodies</span> had substance 
         and a dash of colour, but later both substance and 
         colour dissolved in the <span class="color">green-blue</span> and atmosphere. How 
         hot it was! So hot that even the thrush chose to 
         hop, like a mechanical <span class="nature">bird</span>, in the shadow of the 
         <span class="nature">flowers</span>, with long pauses between one movement and 
         the next; instead of rambling vaguely the <span class="color">white</span> 
         <span class="nature">butterflies</span> danced one above another, making 
         with their <span class="color">white</span> shifting flakes the outline of a 
         shattered marble column above the tallest 
         <span class="nature">flowers</span>; the glass roofs of the <span class="tech">palm house </span>
         shone as if a whole market full 
         of shiny <span class="color">green</span> umbrellas had opened 
         in the <span class="nature">sun</span>; and in the drone of the 
         aeroplane the voice of the summer

         shapes of all these colours, men, women and 
         children were spotted for a second upon the 
         horizon, and then, seeing the breadth of <span class="color">yellow</span> that 
         lay upon the <span class="nature">grass</span>, they wavered and sought shade 
         beneath the <span class="nature">trees</span>, dissolving like drops of <span class="nature">water</span> in 
         the <span class="color">yellow</span> and <span class="color">green</span> atmosphere, staining it faintly with 
         <span class="color">red</span> and <span class="color">blue</span>. It seemed as if all gross and heavy 
         <span class="nature">bodies</span> had sunk down in the heat motionless and lay
         huddled upon the ground, but their voices went wavering 
         from them as if they were flames lolling 
         from the thick waxen <span class="nature">bodies</span> of candles.

         Voices, yes, vioces, breaking the silence
         suddently with such depth of contentment, such passion
         of desire, or, in the voices of children, such freshness
         of surprise; breaking the silence? But there was no
         silence; all the time the <span class="tech">motor omnibuses</span> were turning
         their <span class="tech">wheels</span> and changing their <span class="tech">gear</span>; like a vast
         nest of Chinese boxes all of wrought <span class="tech">steel</span> turning
         ceaselessly one within another the city murmured;
         on the top of which the voices cried aloud and 
         the <span class="nature">petals</span> of myriads of <span class="nature">flowers</span> flashed their colours
