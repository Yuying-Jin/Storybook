        <line n="2"/>by his gestures came two elderly women of the

        <line n="8"/>too far off to be certain whether the gestures

        <line n="10"/>they had scrutinised the old man&apos; back in 
        <line n="11"/>silence for a moment and given each other 
        <line n="12"/>a queer, sly look, they went on energeticlly

        <line n="1"/>The ponderous woman looked through the pattern of falling 
        <line n="2"/>words at the flowers standing cool, firm and upright 
        <line n="3"/>in the earth, with a curious expression. She saw them 
        <line n="4"/>as a sleeper waking from a heavy sleep sees a brass 
        <line n="5"/>candlestick reflecting the light in an unfamiliar way, and 
        <line n="6"/>closes his eyes and opens them, 
        <line n="7"/>and seeing the brass candlestick again, 
        <line n="8"/>finally starts wide awake and stares at the candle-
        <line n="9"/>stick with all his powers. So the heavy 
        <line n="10"/>woman came to a standstill opposite the 
        <line n="11"/>oval shaped flower bed, and ceased even 
        <line n="12"/>to pretend to listen to what the other woman 
        <line n="13"/>was saying. She stood there letting the words fall 
        <line n="14"/>over her, swaying the top part 
        <line n="15"/>of her body slowly backwards 
        <line n="16"/>and forwards, looking at the 
        <line n="17"/>flowers. Then she suggested that 
        <line n="18"/>they should find a seat 
        <line n="19"/>and have their tea.

        <line n="1"/>The snail had now considered every possible method 
        <line n="2"/>of reaching his goal without going round the 
        <line n="3"/>dead leaf or climbing over it. Let alone 
        <line n="4"/>the effort needed for climbing a leaf, he was 
        <line n="5"/>doubtful whether the thin texture which vibrated 
        <line n="6"/>with such an alarming crackle when touched 
        <line n="7"/>even by the tip of his horns would bear his 
        <line n="8"/>weight; and this determined him finally to 
        <line n="9"/>creep and beneath it, for there was a point where 
        <line n="10"/>the leaf curved high enough from the ground 
        <line n="11"/>to admit him. He had just inserted his head 
        <line n="12"/>in the opening and was taking stock of the 
        <line n="13"/>high brown roof and was getting used to the 
        <line n="14"/>cool brown light when two other people came 
        <line n="15"/>past outside on the turf. This time they were 
        <line n="16"/>both young, a young man and a young woman.

        <line n="1"/>They were both in the prime of youth, 
        <line n="2"/>or even in that season which precedes the prime 
        <line n="3"/>of youth, the season before the smooth pink folds 
        <line n="4"/>of the flowers have burst their gummy case, when the 
        <line n="5"/>wings of the butterfly, though fully grown, are motionless 
        <line n="6"/>in the sun.

        <line n="8"/>&quot;Why? D&apos;you believe in luck?&quot;
        <line n="9"/>&quot;They make you pay sixpence on Friday.&quot;
        <line n="10"/>What&apos;s sixpence anyway? Isn&apos;t it worth

        <line n="13"/>&quot;O anything—I mean—you know what I mean.&quot;
        <line n="14"/>Long pauses came between each of these remarks; 
        <line n="15"/>they were uttered in toneless and monotonous voices. 
        <line n="16"/>The couple stood still on the edge of the flower 
        <line n="17"/>bed, and together pressed the end of her parasol 
        <line n="18"/>deep down into the soft earth.

        <line n="1"/>The action and the fact that his hand 
        <line n="2"/>rested on the top of hers expressed their feelings 
        <line n="3"/>in a strange way, as these short insignificant words 
        <line n="4"/>also expressed something, words with short wings 
        <line n="5"/>for their heavy body of meaning, inadequate to 
        <line n="6"/>carry them far and thus alighting awkwardly upon 
        <line n="7"/>the very common objects that surrounded them 
        <line n="8"/>and were to their inexperienced touch so massive: 
        <line n="9"/>but who knows (so they thought as they pressed 
        <line n="10"/>the parasol into the earth) what precipices aren&apos;t 
        <line n="11"/>concealed in them, or what ridges of ice don&apos;t 
        <line n="12"/>shine in the sun on the other side? who 
        <line n="13"/>knows? Who has ever seen this before? Even 
        <line n="14"/>when she wondered what sort of tea they gave 
        <line n="15"/>you at Kew he felt that something loomed up 
        <line n="16"/>behind her words and stood vast and solid behind 
        <line n="17"/>them; and the mist very slowly rose and uncovered

        <line n="1"/>—O heavens!— what were those shapes?—little 
        <line n="2"/>white tables, and waitresses who looked first at 
        <line n="3"/>her and then at him; and there was a bill 
        <line n="4"/>that he would pay with a real two shilling 
        <line n="5"/>piece, and it was real, all real, he assured 
        <line n="6"/>himself, fingering the coin in his pocket, 
        <line n="7"/>real to everyone except to hum and to her; 
        <line n="8"/>even to him it began to seem real; and 
        <line n="9"/>then—but it was too exciting to stand and
        <line n="10"/>think any longer, and he pulled the parasol 
        <line n="11"/>out of the earth with a jerk and was 
        <line n="12"/>impatient to find the place 
        <line n="13"/>where one had tea with other 
        <line n="14"/>people, like other people.

        <line n="1"/>&quot;Come along, Trissie; it&apos;s time we had our

        <line n="3"/>&quot;Wherever does one have one&apos;s tea?" she 
        <line n="4"/>asked with the oddest thrill of excitement 
        <line n="5"/>in her voice, looking vaguely round and letting 
        <line n="6"/>herself be drawn on down the grass path, trailing 
        <line n="7"/>her parasol, turning her head this way and that 
        <line n="8"/>way, forgetting her tea, wishing to go down there 
        <line n="9"/>and then down there, remembering orchids and 
        <line n="10"/>cranes among wild flowers, a Chinese pagoda and 
        <line n="11"/>a crimson-crested bird; but he bore her on.

        <line n="1"/>Thus one couple after another with much the same irregular 
        <line n="2"/>and aimless movement passed the flower-bed and 
        <line n="3"/>were enveloped in layer after layer of green blue 
        <line n="4"/>vapour, in which at first their bodies had substance 
        <line n="5"/>and a dash of colour, but later both substance and 
        <line n="6"/>colour dissolved in the green-blue and atmosphere. How 
        <line n="7"/>hot it was! So hot that even the thrush chose to 
        <line n="8"/>hop, like a mechanical bird, in the shadow of the 
        <line n="9"/>flowers, with long pauses between one movement and 
        <line n="10"/>the next; instead of rambling vaguely the white 
        <line n="11"/>butterflies danced one above another, making 
        <line n="12"/>with their white shifting flakes the outline of a 
        <line n="13"/>shattered marble column above the tallest 
        <line n="14"/>flowers; the glass roofs of the palm house 
        <line n="15"/>shone as if a whole market full 
        <line n="16"/>of shiny green umbrellas had opened 
        <line n="17"/>in the sun; and in the drone of the 
        <line n="18"/>aeroplane the voice of the summer 
        <line n="19"/>sky murmured its fierce soul.

        <line n="4"/>horizon, and then, seeing the breadth of yellow that 
        <line n="5"/>lay upon the grass, they wavered and sought shade 
        <line n="6"/>beneath the trees, dissolving like drops of water in 
        <line n="7"/>the yellow and green atmosphere, staining it faintly with 
        <line n="8"/>red and blue. It seemed as if all gross and heavy 
        <line n="9"/>bodies had sunk down in the heat motionless and lay
        <line n="10"/>huddled upon the ground, but their voices went wavering 
        <line n="11"/>from them as if they were flames lolling 
        <line n="12"/>from the thick waxen bodies of candles.

        <line n="1"/>Voices, yes, vioces, breaking the silence
        <line n="2"/>suddently with such depth of contentment, such psassion
        <line n="3"/>of desire, or, in the voices of children, such freshness
        <line n="4"/>of surprise; breaking the silence? But there was no
        <line m="5"/>silence; all the time the motor omnibuses were turning
        <line n="6"/>their wheels and changing their gear; like a vast
        <line n="7"/>nest of Chinese boxes all of wrought steel turning
        <line n="8"/>ceaselessly one within another the city murmured;
        <line n="9"/>on the top of which the voices cried aloud and 
        <line n="10"/>the petals of myriads of flowers flashed their colours
        <line n="11"/>into the air.
